# EDA-on-New-Year-Resolution
EDA on New Year Resolution on Twitter made in 2015

Objective:
The objective of this data science project was to analyze New Year resolutions shared on Twitter during the past year and gain insights into popular trends, sentiment, and topics related to people's resolutions.

Key Findings:
1. *Top Resolutions:* The most prevalent New Year resolutions on Twitter were related to health and fitness, personal growth, and mental well-being. Fitness goals, such as exercising regularly and maintaining a healthy diet, topped the list, followed closely by resolutions related to learning new skills and pursuing hobbies.

2. *Temporal Trends:* The volume of resolution-related tweets peaked in the first week of January, suggesting that people are most enthusiastic about sharing their goals at the beginning of the year. However, the frequency of resolution tweets gradually declined throughout the year.

Interpretation of Results:
The dominance of health and fitness resolutions underscores the increasing emphasis on personal well-being and a health-conscious lifestyle. The decline in resolution tweets over the year may suggest that some individuals find it challenging to sustain their commitment to their goals beyond the initial burst of enthusiasm. The mixture of positive and negative sentiments reflects the complex nature of personal change and the journey of self-improvement.

Limitations:
While the data provides valuable insights, this analysis is limited to public tweets and may not capture the full range of resolutions made by individuals. Additionally, sentiment analysis has inherent challenges, and the accuracy of sentiment classification may vary.

Recommendations:
To expand on this analysis, incorporating demographic information and location-based data could provide a more nuanced understanding of regional variations in resolutions. Conducting longitudinal studies to track individuals' resolution progress over time may offer valuable insights into persistence and success rates.

Conclusion and Implications:
This data science project provides valuable insights into the nature of New Year resolutions on Twitter. The prevalence of health and fitness-related resolutions suggests a growing awareness of the importance of well-being. Understanding the challenges and sentiments associated with resolutions can help design better support systems for individuals aiming to achieve their goals.
